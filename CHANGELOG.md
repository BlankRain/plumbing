## 0.0.2
 * Minor bugfixes and improved tests
 * Perf improvements for `map-keys` and `map-vals` (thanks [bendlas](https://github.com/bendlas)!)
 * Pulled out [lazymap](https://bitbucket.org/kotarak/lazymap) as a dependency.  `plumbing.lazymap` is no more -- it's now included indirectly as `lazymap.core`.  Thanks to Meikel Brandmeyer for a great library, and working with us to extend it to accommodate Graph's use case.

## 0.0.1

 * Initial release
